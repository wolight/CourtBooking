======================

Further comments on your Phase 2 to improve towards following phases are 
as follows:
Search page needs top bar. Suggest making the typeface consistent.
Most of your requirements are present here, but the overall style of the 
pages is very basic. Try to make your project look like a professional 
website and make sure your responsive css works. Smartphones can't use 
this site well right now. The titles on your pages should match what the 
pages is (about half have the title "CSC309 A1"). Finally, there's a lot 
of code to handle date and time pickers. It might be easier to use 
HTML5's inputs for those or the jQuery UI options.
